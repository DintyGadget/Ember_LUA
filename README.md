# Ember_LUA
Welcome to Ember Roleplay's LUA repo. 

Ember's LUA was designed for Wrath of the Lich King 3.3.5a World of Warcraft client to be ran alongside a TrinityCore emulator with rochet2's integrated LUA engine.

This repo is free use for any projects interested in our features we wish to share. If users need installation support, bug fixing, or further assistance, please contact grimreapaa#4214 on discord.
