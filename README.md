# Ember_LUA
Welcome to Ember Roleplay's LUA repo. 

Ember's LUA was designed for Wrath of the Lich King 3.3.5a World of Warcraft client to be ran alongside a TrinityCore emulator with rochet2's integrated LUA engine.

Further details of organization, global variables, where shit is, etc, will be slowly published here.

Some tips for navigating the repo in its current state:
- Use folders 'WIP', 'globals', and 'finished'. Almost everything else is sourced from rochet2 or an addon delivered via AIO.
- Globals should have a config file to be continued upon. Other files should have their adjustments as variables at the top. IE: TIMER_IN_SECONDS = 60 would imply the script's timer could be changed from 60 seconds.

This repo is free use for any projects interested in our features we wish to share. If users need installation support, bug fixing, or further assistance, please contact grimreapaa#4214 on discord.
